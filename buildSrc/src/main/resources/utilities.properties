# <-- Access Transformers -->
# <------------------------->
# A way to change visibility of Minecraft's classes, methods and fields
# An example access transformer file is given in the path: `src/main/resources/example_at.cfg`
# AT files should be in the root of src/main/resources with the filename formatted as: `mod_id_at.cfg`

# If multiple locations are stated, use spaces as the delimiter

# <-- Core Mod -->
# <-------------->
# The most powerful way to change java classes at runtime, it is however very primitive with little documentation.
# Only make a coremod if you are absolutely sure of what you are doing
# Change the property `coremod_includes_mod` to false if your coremod doesn't have a @Mod annotation
# You MUST state a class name for `coremod_plugin_class_name` if you are making a coremod, the class should implement `IFMLLoadingPlugin`

# <-- Tags -->
# <---------->
# A RetroFuturaGradle concept akin to Ant ReplaceTokens
# A class is generated at build-time for compilation, to describe property that have values that could change at build time such as versioning
# Class name is configurable with the `tag_class_name` property
# Tag property can be stated in the `gradle/property/tags.property` file, references are allowed
